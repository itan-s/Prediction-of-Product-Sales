# prediction-of-product-sales

## Introduction

This project is a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores. The goal of this is to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales. The dataset is from the Big Mart Sales Practice Problem at Analytics Vidhya.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Correlation among the numerical features in the dataset

![Heatmap](https://github.com/itan-s/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/assets/151743020/c431ec22-60bb-4828-a95e-31012d054db5)

Observations:
* There is a moderate positive correlation between the Item_MRP and Item_Outlet_Sales with a correlation coefficient of 0.57.
* The positive relationship between the item MRP and outlet sales can be an expected result since a higher MRP may lead to higher outlet sales.
* Surprisingly, the visibility of the items in stores does not have a significant correlation with the outlet sales.
